The classification result as one of: \"summary\", \"unrelated\", \"general store\", \"specific product\", \"category\". A \"category\" question is something that is a general product grouping in nature, while a \"specific product\" is asking about a certain product directly. A \"general store\" question is asking about the store in general, and a \"summary\" question is asking for a summary of the store\"s products. \"unrelated\" is a catch-all for questions that don\"t fit into any of the other categories. The difference between \"category\" and specific product is nuanced. For example this is a category: I need a pair of headphones that are really lightweight. While this is a specific product: I need the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones."
